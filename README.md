# Personal README
Hello, welcome to my personal README. Hopefully, this gives you some context to understand me better and help devise a strong working relationship.

## My Goals

My Goals at WP Engine include:
- Learning new skills.
- Working with new and exciting technologies.
- Deliving high quality working code.
- Being generally available to help with whatever the team needs.

## Things you should know about me
A lot of my experience prior to WPE was in building backend systems typically in Java. The backend is still where I prefer to spend my time, but really I've
worked all across the stack.

I'm not really a morning person by nature, but I've been trying to be since coming to WPE. It isn't too unusual for me to be online and available
somewhat early, but I don't really enjoy early meetings etc. I need a little time to wake up!

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking. When the weather is nice (and often enough when it isn't) it is not unusual for me to be outside using my grill or smoker.

## What I value
- I like to get things done, but I sometimes feel we don't spend enough time thinking through the problem before moving on to coding. I find trying to 
identify some of the risks in a project beforehand can make a project run smoother and help to get the team on the same page.
- Continued learning and growth as a software professional.
- Fewer meetings/more async distribution of information where applicable.
- Open and direct communication.

## The Day-To-Day

### PRs & Code reviews
I try to periodically check GitHub for PRs that need attention, but I know I can miss things especially if I'm heads down working on something. Feel free
to send me a reminder in slack if there is anything you need from me.

### Communication
I prefer async communication over meetings where possible, though I certainly don't mind hopping on a zoom call if/when that is helpful. 

Feel free to reach out to me with anything you feel I can help with.
